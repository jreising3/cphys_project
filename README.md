# Tight Binding and Anderson Localization on Arbitrary Graphs with Anharmonic Time Dependence 






# Introduction
This project adds to the prior work "Tight Binding and Anderson Localization on Arbitrary Graphs", which implemented the tight binding model for an electron on an arbitrary graph structure. Here we incorprate a anharmonic time dependence term into our hamilitonian, while also including [Anderson Localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_localization) in the same manner as the prior work. We calculate the thermodynamic quanties like [Von Neumann entropy] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory))
